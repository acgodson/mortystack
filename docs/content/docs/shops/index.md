#### Hosting Blockchain enabled catalogs on MortyStack

###### 2. **Zero Commissions**

            - "Unlike popular marketplaces like shopify, OpenSea etc.
            You don't have to worry about those other charges"

### How to Create a Custom Shop

1. **Access Your Morty Account:**

   - Log in to your Morty Wallet account.

   - Complete Subscription and Create an Organziation & record on chain.

2. **Navigate to Shops Tab:**

###### Use Case

Suppose you create a custom shop named "ArtisanTreasures." Morty Wallet will assign the subdomain domain "artisantreasures.mortsystack.xyz" for your shop.

Now, visitors can explore your curated collection, whether it includes unique NFTs or handcrafted goods, and complete purchases seamlessly using Morty's integrated checkout. Morty will issue a receipt and the contract would hold the asset until you return to claim it
